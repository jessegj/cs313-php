        <p>Hello, my name is Jesse. Welcome to my page! I have only three semesters left after this one and I am excited to graduate. What I love to do is design and build my own Lego sets. I did not start doing it on a large scale until about 2012 - 2013. I design them through software that I have and then connect online and find the parts I need to make my project. It is a blast and allows me to build and design a little at a time.</p>
